## How does Bront differ from Ubuntu Mono?

In Bront:

- `$` has a full pillar
- `0` has a slash
- `_` is narrower in order to discern consecutive characters
- `-` is the same width as `_`
- `*` is centered vertically to align with `+`, `-`, and `=`
- `G` has a horizontal bar
- `%` has actual circles
- `i`, `j`, `l`, and `J` do not have serifs
- `J` has a longer tail
- `*` has 6 spokes
- `~` is more wavy in order to further differentiate it from `-`
- `t` has the same ascender height as `l`
